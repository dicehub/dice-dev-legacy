				 <h4>Default Behavior</h4>
				 If specified, the rng keyword must be accompanied by either rnum2 (pseudo-random numbers) or mt19937 (random numbers generated by the Mersenne twister). Otherwise, mt19937, the Mersenne twister is used by default.

				Morris One-at-a-Time.
				<h4>Description</h4>
				The Morris One-At-A-Time (MOAT) method, originally proposed by Morris, is a screening method, designed to explore a computational model to distinguish between input variables that have negligible, linear and additive, or nonlinear or interaction effects on the output. The computer experiments performed consist of individually randomized designs which vary one input factor at a time to create a sample of its elementary effects.

The number of samples (samples) must be a positive integer multiple of (number of continuous design variable + 1) and will be automatically adjusted if misspecified.

The number of partitions (partitions) applies to each variable being studied and must be odd (the number of MOAT levels per variable is partitions + 1). This will also be adjusted at runtime as necessary.

For information on practical use of this method.
