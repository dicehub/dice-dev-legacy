				maxConcave
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Max concaveness allowed. Is angle (in degrees) below which concavity
                is allowed. 0 is straight face, <0 would be convex face.
                Set to 180 to disable.

			<dd>
				Minimum pyramid volume. Is absolute volume of cell pyramid.
                Set to a sensible fraction of the smallest cell volume expected.
                Set to very negative number (e.g. -1E30) to disable.

			<dd>
				Minimum quality of the tet formed by the face-centre
                and variable base point minimum decomposition triangles and
                the cell centre. This has to be a positive number for tracking
                to work. Set to very negative number (e.g. -1E30) to
                disable.
                <0 = inside out tet,
                0 = flat tet

			</dd>

        <dl>
			<dt id="minDeterminant">
				minDeterminant
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Minimum normalised cell determinant. This is the determinant of all
                the areas of internal faces. It is a measure of how much of the
                outside area of the cell is to other cells. The idea is that if all
                outside faces of the cell are 'floating' (zeroGradient) the
                'fixedness' of the cell is determined by the area of the internal faces.
                1 = hex, <= 0 = folded or flattened illegal cell

			<dt id="minTriangleTwist">
				minTriangleTwist
			</dt>
			<dd>
				Per triangle normal compared to average normal. Like face twist
                but now per (face-centre decomposition) triangle. Must be >0 for Fluent
                compatibility.

				if >0 : preserve cells with all points on the surface if the
                resulting volume after snapping (by approximation) is larger than
                minVolCollapseRatio times old volume (i.e. not collapsed to flat cell).
                If <0 : delete always.
